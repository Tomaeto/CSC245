                        Project 1 Questions:
1. The DList class has the following attributes:
        NodeType<ItemType>* head
        int length
Structs are being used so the DList class is compatible with
any data type or object.

2.
- isEmpty returns a bool indicating if the list is empty or not.
- inList returns a bool indicating if an entered value is in the list or not.
- makeEmpty deletes every node in the list and sets head to NULL.
- insertHead adds an item to the list at the head.
- appendTail adds an item to the list at the back.
- print prints the info of each node in the list.
- lengthIs returns the length of the list.
- deleteItem deletes an item from the list as well as its location.
- last returns a pointer to the last node in the list.
- location returns a pointer to the node in the list with the item sent as a parameter.
If there are no nodes with that parameter, returns NULL;
- deleteLocation deletes the location sent as a parameter and links the adjacent nodes if necessary.

3. The Move to the Front Algorithm moves the last item accessed to the front of the list, which
is done so that recently accessed items can be accessed again more quickly.

4. The client file mainly follows an algorithm that takes a char input from the user, sets it to
uppercase, compares it with the possible options of the program, and runs the corresponding program.
If the input does not match an option, the program prints an error message. This continues until
the user inputs the char corresponding with the 'Quit' option of the program, at which point the 
program exits.
